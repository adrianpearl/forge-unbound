Scroll down to [configure](/#donation-config) this page for your campaign - replace the above image with your logo, this text with your call to action (or your entire policy platform if you want), and add other customization options.\n\n2. Create an account with just an FED ID and a Stripe account with an organization name matching your FEC committee name.\n\n3. Once we verify your information (give us a day or two), deploy your portal and start taking donations. Configure a custom domain if you want, or embed on your campaign website.\n\n5. Add additional portals, reporting and analytics tools, email campaigns, and voter registration lookup to build out your campaign tech stack.\n\n6. Need more customization?
